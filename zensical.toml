# Zensical configuration for GIG Cymru NHS Wales - Architecture
# Migrated from mkdocs.yml
#
# Navigation: Zensical auto-discovers navigation from the docs directory structure.
# Navigation customization is controlled via .nav.yml files in the source directories:
#   - doc/.nav.yml: Main navigation structure
#   - doc/design-authority/dhcw/meetings/.nav.yml: Meetings sorted by path
