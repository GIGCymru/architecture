# Contributing

We welcome people contributing. We welcome feedback, suggestions, ideas, and help.

## Public and Internal Repositories

Please note that this project maintains two separate repositories:

1.  **Internal Repository** (`architecture-internal`): This is where all active development, discussions, and reviews occur.
2.  **Public Repository** (`architecture`): This is a read-only, public-facing mirror that is automatically updated from the internal repository.

**All contributions must be made to the internal repository.**

## How to Contribute

To contact the team, a good way is to create a GitHub issue in the **internal** repository.

To contribute content or code:
1.  **Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes in the **internal** repository.
2.  **Changes**: Make your changes and test them locally (see [README.md](README.md) for setup instructions).
3.  **Pull Request**: Create a GitHub Pull Request against the `main` branch of the **internal** repository.

Once a Pull Request is merged into the `main` branch of the internal repository, selected files are automatically synchronized to the public repository based on the `sync-public.toml` manifest.

To email a particular person, contact information will typically be provided in the top level [README.md](README.md) file.
