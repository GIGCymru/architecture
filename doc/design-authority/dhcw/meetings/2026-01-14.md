## Overview

Notes from the TDA Development Session on 14th January 2026, focusing on reviewing 2025 achievements, identifying
current challenges, and setting objectives for 2026. These objectives will feed into the next TDA session scheduled
for Friday 20th February 2026 (10:00-11:30).

## Action for Members

Let the chair know if members believe there is a representative that should be at TDA that isn't currently invited and
explain why, for consideration.

## Session Agenda

## 1. Introductions and Agenda Overview

The CPTO introduced the session and outlined the agenda: a review of 2025 achievements, an interactive session to
identify current challenges, setting objectives for 2026, discussion on national alignment, and wrap-up.

## 2. Review of 2025 Achievements

The CPTO summarized key 2025 accomplishments:

- Expansion of governance domains to include User-Centred Design (UCD) and Clinical domains
- Agreement and updates to level 1 and level 2 architectural principles, with most being endorsed at the national
    architecture community (via the national architecture project).
- Shift from committee review to expert-led, trust-and-verify governance.
- Launch of a public-facing website for TDA principles and decisions.
- Introduction of standardized Architecture Design Overviews (ADOs) and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
- Establishment of a central Enterprise Architecture repository (Ardoq) as part of the national architecture
    project.

Participants reflected on the progress, noting strong foundational work but recognizing that implementation and
adoption across the organization remain ongoing challenges.

## 3. Retrospective: Challenges, Frictions, and Problems

The group used a whiteboard to capture challenges and discussed:

- Need for practical training and reinforcement of new documentation approaches (e.g., ARC 42, GitHub, ADRs).
- Friction for staff less familiar with technical tools like GitHub and markdown, leading to parallel Word-based
    processes.
- Variation in participation and adoption of processes across the organization.
- Unclear authority and accountability within domains, and the need to clarify roles and responsibilities.
- Overlap and confusion between principles, decisions, and ways of working.
- Technical debt reporting is not effective, with uncertainty about what constitutes technical debt and how to
    manage it.
- Slow decision-making, especially around principles, and the need to balance thoroughness with progress.
- Membership and coverage of TDA/TDAG—whether the right people and expertise are present, and if domain-specific
    subgroups are needed.
- Lack of clear project lifecycle and assurance gates, leading to late engagement with assurance processes.
- Relationship and alignment with external assurance bodies (e.g., WIAG, national boards) and the need for better
    integration.

Participants debated whether to maintain broad domain groups or create more focused, domain-specific assurance groups
(e.g., for data, application, infrastructure).

The complexity and breadth of data assurance was highlighted, with suggestions for dedicated data architecture and
governance groups.

The need for flexible, subject-specific subgroups for deep dives was discussed, as well as the importance of
cross-domain discussions for issues that span multiple areas.

## 4. Objectives for 2026

The group synthesized challenges into three main objectives for 2026:

### Objective 1: Raise Awareness and Training

Improve communication, training, and practical support for new architecture processes, tools, and documentation
standards.

The group emphasized the need to improve awareness and understanding of new architecture processes, including the use
of Architecture Design Overviews (ADOs), Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), and the ARC 42 documentation approach.

There was consensus that practical training, workshops, and clear communication are required to embed these practices
across all teams, as current adoption is inconsistent and some staff are unfamiliar with technical tools like GitHub
and markdown.

Suggestions included leveraging the new learning pathway platform and providing hands-on support, not just theoretical
frameworks.

### Objective 2: Strengthen Operating Model and Resourcing

Ensure sufficient administrative and technical support for TDA/TDAG, clarify roles, and improve the management and
running of assurance processes.

Participants discussed the need for more dedicated administrative and technical support for TDA/TDAG activities, as
current processes rely heavily on goodwill and ad hoc contributions, particularly for managing ADRs, ADOs, and GitHub
administration.

There was recognition that running effective technical assurance requires a sustainable operating model, potentially
with additional staff or clearer allocation of responsibilities.

The group noted the importance of documenting and sharing the operating model so everyone understands their roles and
the support available.

Technical debt management and reporting were also discussed as part of this objective, with a need to clarify
definitions, improve tracking, and ensure that remediation actions are planned and resourced.

### Objective 3: Refresh Terms of Reference and Membership

Review and update the purpose, scope, and membership of TDA/TDAG, consider domain-specific subgroups, and clarify the
relationship with national and external assurance bodies.

The group agreed to review and update the terms of reference (ToR) for TDA and TDAG, including clarifying the purpose
of each group (e.g., decision assurance vs. communication/show-and-tell).

There was discussion about whether to establish domain-specific subgroups (e.g., for data, application,
infrastructure) to better address specialized assurance needs and manage the breadth of topics.

The need to clarify membership, authority, and accountability within domains was highlighted, ensuring the right
expertise is present and that roles are well understood.

The group also discussed the relationship with national and external assurance bodies, and how changes at the national
level should be reflected locally.

### 2026 Objective Next Steps

The group agreed to use these objectives as the foundation for concrete action planning in the next TDA session, with
a focus on measurable outcomes and ongoing review.

## 5. National Alignment and External Relationships

The CPTO updated on the formation of a new national Architecture and Standards Board, chaired by Mark Wardle, with the
aim of ratifying national principles and aligning local TDA structures with national governance. Discussion covered:

- The process for adopting and updating national principles at the local level.
- The authority of the national board over local organizations and the need for clear reporting and escalation
    processes.
- The importance of publishing principles and decisions for transparency, while recognizing that not all internal
    decisions are relevant at the national level.

## 6. Wrap-Up and Next Steps

The CPTO summarized the three main objectives for 2026 and proposed that concrete actions be agreed at the next TDA
session (scheduled for Friday 20th February 2026, 10:00-11:30), using the outcomes of this workshop as a foundation.

The meeting closed with thanks to participants and a plan to circulate notes and schedule follow-up sessions.
