# Introduction

The Digital Health and Care Wales (DHCW) Technical Design Authority (TDA) is a key
governance body that commissions, owns, and steers the development of DHCW's
Enterprise Architecture. The TDA ensures alignment with strategic objectives of
both the organisation and wider Health and Care policy and strategy.

The TDA is supported by the Technical Design Assurance Group (TDAG), which
maintains the integrity of the architecture by reviewing and approving
significant changes to platforms and products, and ensuring compliance with
approved principles and standards.
