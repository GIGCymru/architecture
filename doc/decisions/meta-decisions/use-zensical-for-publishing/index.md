**Con:**

* Significantly higher migration effort (complete rewrite of configuration and customizations)
* Loss of familiarity and institutional knowledge
* Different design philosophies may not align with our requirements
* No guarantee of better long-term support than Zensical
* Would lose connection to Material for MkDocs design patterns our team knows
* Risk of choosing a platform that doesn't align with our Python-centric approach

**Other:**

* Moving to non-Python platforms would create inconsistency with our technical stack
* Would lose the benefit of the Material for MkDocs team's continued expertise

## Recommendation

**Adopt Zensical as our static site generator for publishing architecture documentation**, migrating from Material for MkDocs.

### Rationale

Zensical represents the natural evolution of Material for MkDocs by its original creators. By migrating now, we:

1. **Align with the future**: The Material for MkDocs team's focus and innovation efforts will be directed at Zensical, ensuring we benefit from ongoing enhancements and improvements

2. **Gain performance improvements**: Build times of 3-4 seconds provide faster feedback loops during development and more efficient CI/CD pipelines

3. **Reduce complexity**: Built-in features eliminate the need for multiple plugins (mkdocs-awesome-nav, table-reader), simplifying our configuration and reducing dependency management overhead

4. **Maintain continuity**: The "classic" theme variant preserves our existing visual design and user experience, minimizing disruption for documentation consumers

5. **Improve developer experience**: Modern TOML configuration, better error messages, and streamlined workflows make it easier for team members to contribute to documentation

6. **Ensure long-term sustainability**: As the team's primary platform going forward, Zensical will receive active development, new features, and sustained support for years to come

7. **Minimize migration risk**: High compatibility with Material for MkDocs design patterns and markdown extensions means migration is straightforward and low-risk

The migration effort is justified by the long-term benefits of aligning with the platform's future trajectory. Delaying migration would only increase future effort as our documentation grows.

### Consequences

**Pro:**

* Future-proof platform choice backed by the team that created Material for MkDocs
