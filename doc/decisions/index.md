# Architecture Decisions

!!! warning

    The ADR Process, Template and this site are iterating rapidly right now as
    we seek to introduce ADRs and change our ways of working. Content may be at
    different levels of completeness and consistency right now, this will
    improve with time.

This section contains all architecture decisions that have been made and documented
using our [Architecture Decision Records (ADR) process](../design-authority/dhcw/architecture-decision-record-process/index.md).
The decisions are organised into three main categories:

Each decision is documented using our standard [ADR Template](../design-authority/dhcw/architecture-decision-record-template.md),
which ensures consistent and complete documentation of the context,
consequences, and rationale behind each choice.

## Meta Decisions

Meta decisions are decisions about how we make and document decisions. These
include choices about our ADR process itself, documentation standards, and tooling.
These includes decisions about:

- Naming conventions for ADRs
- Documentation format and tools
- Site navigation enhancements
- Quality assurance tools like linters and spell checkers

## Process Decisions

Process decisions document important choices about how we work and operate.
For example, these cover areas such as:

- Security processes (e.g., vulnerability disclosure)
- Development workflows
- Operational procedures

## Technical Decisions

Technical decisions are specific architectural choices about our systems,
technologies, and implementations. These are include decisions about:

- Technology selections
- System architectures
- Integration patterns
- Security implementations
- Infrastructure choices
