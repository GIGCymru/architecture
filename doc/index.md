# Welcome to NHS Wales Architecture

This site serves as a repository for sharing NHS Wales architectural
knowledge, decisions, and principles. It is maintained by [Digital Health and Care Wales (DHCW)](https://dhcw.nhs.wales/).

## What You'll Find Here

### Architecture Principles

Our [Architecture Principles](principles/index.md) guide how we design and build
systems across NHS Wales. These principles cover areas including:

- User-Centred Design
- Security and Identity
- Cloud and Infrastructure
- Digital Products and Software Engineering
- Data and Analytics
- Open Architecture

### Architecture Decisions

We use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document important architectural
choices, including their context, consequences, and rationale. This
documentation helps teams understand not just what was decided, but why those
decisions were made.

Our decisions are organised into three categories:

- **Meta Decisions**: Decisions about our ADR process itself, documentation
  standards, and tooling
- **Process Decisions**: Decisions about how we work, including security
  processes, development workflows, and operational procedures
- **Technical Decisions**: Technology choices, system architectures, integration
  patterns, and infrastructure decisions

### Design Authority

The [DHCW Technical Design Authority](design-authority/index.md) (TDA) oversees
architectural decisions and ensures alignment with NHS Wales's strategic
objectives. You'll find:

- Our ADR process and templates
- Terms of reference
- Meeting records and decisions
- Enterprise architecture metamodel
