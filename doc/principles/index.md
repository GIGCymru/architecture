# Architecture Principles

Architecture principles are fundamental rules and guidelines that inform and
support the way we design and develop technology solutions across NHS Wales. They
help ensure consistency, promote best practices, and align our technology
decisions with organisational goals. They must be adopted when building
and procuring technical solutions.

Our principles are developed and approved by the [DHCW Technical Design Authority (TDA)](../design-authority/dhcw/terms-of-reference/index.md).

Principles apply across various contexts, technologies, and systems and are
stable over time, even as specific technologies or situations change.

Our principles help us make consistent choices when faced with new or ambiguous
situations where detailed rules may not exist or apply. They provide a
'compass' rather than a detailed 'map'.

To ensure that digital systems applications and services are aligned to health
and care strategy, complying with these principles should form part of the
governance for technical solutions, alongside architectural decision records
and defined interoperability standards.

The principles are a guide for decision making, there will be circumstances
where a trade-off needs to be made between strict adherence with the principles
and other considerations.

The rationale for not complying with the principles should be documented, for
example through an architectural decision record. To the greatest extent
possible, there should be an understanding of the route to compliance, and a
target timetable to compliance.

These principles have been derived from the [NHS England Architecture Principles January 2021 v4](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/architecture/principles).
They also reflect the [Digital Service Standards for Wales](https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/guidance-and-standards/digital-service-standards-wales)
published by the [Centre for Digital Public Services](https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/).

## Approved Principles

The following principles have been formally reviewed and approved by the DHCW
Technical Design Authority (TDA):

* [Architecture Principles](architecture-principles/index.md) - Our foundational
  principles that guide all architectural decisions
* [Cloud & Infrastructure](cloud-and-infrastructure/index.md) - Principles for
  cloud adoption and infrastructure design
* [Data & Analytics](data-and-analytics/index.md) - Guidelines for data
  management, analytics, and insights
* [Digital Products & Software Engineering](digital-products-and-software-engineering/index.md) -
  Best practices for building and maintaining digital products
* [Digital Workplace](digital-workplace/index.md) - Principles for creating
  effective digital working environments
* [Open Architecture & Integration](open-architecture/index.md) - Guidelines for
  creating interoperable and extensible systems
* [Security & Identity](security-and-identity/index.md) - Core security and
  identity management principles
* [User-Centred Design](user-centred-design/index.md) - Principles for creating
  services that meet user needs

## Principles Under Development

The following principles are currently being developed and reviewed. While not yet
formally approved, they provide valuable guidance in their respective areas:

* [Clinical Principles](clinical/index.md) - Guidelines for clinical systems
  and healthcare technology

## Using These Principles

These principles should be:

* Referenced when making architectural decisions
* Used to evaluate proposed solutions
* Considered during system design and development
* Referenced in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

If you need to deviate from these principles, document your rationale in an ADR
and seek appropriate approval through the [Governance Process](../design-authority/dhcw/architecture-decision-record-process/index.md).
