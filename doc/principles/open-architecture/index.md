# Open Architecture & Integration Principles

!!! success "Approved"

    These principles have been approved by the DHCW TDA

## API First

APIs will be the primary interface through which our platforms and products
interact and exchange data.

## Open Architecture

Our architecture will be open, enabled by discoverable, well documented,
standards based and reusable APIs and governed by appropriate and proportionate
onboarding processes.

## Open Standards

Interactions and data exchange between platforms and products will be based on
open standards by default.

## Secure by Design

Our APIs, platforms and products will be designed and built to be secure from
the ground up.

## Shift assurance left

Assurance, governance and quality will be built into our platforms and products
from the ground up.

## User centric & focused on value

Platforms and products will be designed with our users in mind and architecture
decisions will consider what will generate the best return of value in the
long run.

## Flexible, Modular & Scalable

We will design our platforms and products to be flexible, modular and scalable.
