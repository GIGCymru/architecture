# Digital Workplace Principles

!!! success "Approved"

    These principles have been approved by the DHCW TDA

## Employee experience is always a key priority

When designing, implementing, configuring or procuring products for the Digital
Workplace, the employee (end-user) experience is always a key priority. Systems
should be designed to meet user needs. Staff need to have the right tools for
the right job.

## Support must be proactive in nature and driven by data

Proactive support reduces avoidable downtime and service disruption for our
employees. Monitoring the user experience and underpinning infrastructure
enables a shift to more proactive incident and problem management.

## Flexibility to work effectively from multiple locations and on multiple devices

Employees will have the same rich digital workplace experience from all approved
locations, whether from a DHCW office, other NHS premises or a location with
only internet access, and from any approved device.

Solutions must be designed to support an optimal hybrid-working experience and
employees who have a blended work pattern (office, home/remote).

## The Digital Workplace exploits AI and Automation

AI and automation supports and augments the work of the employee, freeing up
time for higher-value work and improved employee wellbeing.

## Adopt modern technologies and best practices

Modern technologies and practices provide a richer digital experience for
employees, allowing them to benefit from the latest features and services to
support them in their work.

## Security as an enabler

Robust security measures must be implemented to both protect data and resources,
but also facilitate enhanced production, collaboration and innovation.

## Digital First

Systems and processes that support the Digital Workplace should be digital by
design, reducing and eventually removing the need for manual alternatives.

## Reduce the Carbon Footprint

Reducing the carbon footprint of the Digital Workplace is essential to support
decarbonisation goals.

## Supporting the accessibility needs of workforce

Systems that underpin the Digital Workplace must enable all staff to work to the
best of their abilities and support any staff with particular needs.

## Supporting the use of the Welsh Language

We will ensure that Welsh language interfaces and supporting technology is made
easily available to our users. Welsh language requirements will be included as
part of the procurement for relevant services.

## Internet First

When designing, implementing, configuring or procuring products for the Digital
Workplace.
