# Cloud and Infrastructure Principles

!!! success "Approved"

    These principles have been approved by the DHCW TDA

## Multi Cloud

For SaaS solutions and specialist PaaS services, we will choose our provider
based on analysis of capabilities in the marketplace. For IaaS and generic PaaS
deployments we will identify a single provider of these services.

## Make security easy to adopt

Common security tooling and monitoring to be implemented for all clouds. We will
build the underpinning cloud security infrastructure and monitoring systems, so
that these are available for everyone to use. Technical solutions
(guardrails/policies) will be implemented to reduce risk of user error when
configuring cloud services.

## Design for portability

Design for portability and avoid vendor lock-in unless there is compelling case
for doing so.

## Design for self-service

Leverage automation for infrastructure deployment, configuration management,
and testing. Utilise Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices and continuous
integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Self-service should be
adopted where possible.

## Keep the network simple, resilient and reliable

The network systems should be kept as simple as possible with a focus on
reliability and availability, even during periods of planned maintenance.

## Optimise cloud benefits

Maximise the benefits of using the cloud. Utilise the cloud services that
deliver most value to the organisation. Select the most optimum service model
(SaaS, FaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc). Offload management overhead where possible.

## Design for elasticity and cost optimisation

Design for efficiency and cost minimisation â€“ lever the elasticity of cloud
services.

## Design for reliability

Design for high-availability, resilience, data protection and disaster recovery.
Follow best practices and patterns available from the relevant cloud provider.

## Design for performance

Design applications and infrastructure to ensure that they meet user response
time expectations and can grow and adapt to changes in demand.

## Consider open-source first

Optimise use of Open-Source vs Proprietary products. Choose the most
economically advantageous solution.

## Simplify and standardise

Avoid technology sprawl. Balance the supportability implications of technology
choices with the benefits of using unfamiliar technologies.
