# User-Centred Design (UCD) Principles

!!! success "Approved"

    These principles have been approved by the DHCW TDA

## Start with user needs

Test your assumptions.

Public services are for everyone and must be driven by user needs.

User research prevents wasted resources and reveals real problems,
enabling evidence-based, cost-effective decisions.

## Design with  data

Use data to make decision.

Continuously monitor service performance and use data and user feedback to
prioritise improvements and identify problems that need to be fixed

## Do the hard work to make it simple and inclusive

Make the service easy to use and make sure everyone can use it.

Design inclusively, ensuring easy access for all, including those often
excluded.

Healthcare can be complex. Do the hard work to make it simpler

## Design for outcome and context

Consider what good will look like, how it fits with the entire services, and how
you will measure outcomes.

Understand users and their needs in the context of health and care.

## Iterate. Learn, Improve

Use an incremental, fast-paced approach to get working products into users’
hands as early as possible, as often as possible.

Rapidly iterate and focus on the improvements that have the most value, based on
user feedback.

## Make things open and consistent

Use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns and share
what you’re doing whenever you can.

## Design services in Welsh and English

Design and build services that promote and ease the use of Welsh and treat those
who speak it equally with those who speak English.

## Design for trust

Services must be secure and safe to maintain users’ trust.

Digital information, tools and services have the potential to cause patient
harm.

Respect and protect users' confidentiality and privacy.

## Minimise environmental impact

The climate crisis is a health crisis.

Follow sustainability best practice to reduce the environmental impact of your
service across its lifespan.
